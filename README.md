# LDP_Pose_Estimation

Longboard push and pump techniques are difficult to verbalise. While visual methods can be helpful, some movements are simply too nuanced. Several pre-trained ML models are deployed in this method to address those limitaions. 

Hopefully, LDP_Pose_Estimation can help to visualize the nuances of longboarding using visual comparison and data visualisation.
