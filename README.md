# LDP_Pose_Estimation

Longboarding (pushing and pumping) involves many coordinated movements and describing it effectively is a challenging task. Current body of forums and comunitites rely on idioms and loosely explained kinematics to verbalise their personal experience of longboarding, with no quantative method of description exists. The following is a summary of challenges:

1) There are many methods to push and pump.
2) Each method involves coordinated movements that is difficult to describe clearly.
3) Kinematics and idioms are not easy to understand, requiring knowledge of physics or "getting it".

LDP_Pose_Estimation seeks to propose a visual analytics based method to decribe the nuances of longboarding movements. While a video format is commonly accessible and generaly a good format for teaching, it is not without its limitations. Several pre-trained ML models are deployed in this method to address those limitaions.

Hopefully, a completed project would mean that:
1) A longboarder can convey how he/she longboards effectively using this tool and without the need to say a word.
2) A longboarder can improve him/herself by comparing visual results (rather than with idioms, pseudo kinematics or feelings).
